I am researcher and software engineer currently working for [Polymathic AI](https://polymathic-ai.org/) to accelerate science with AI and HPC.

I completed my PhD in computer science and applied mathematics at Université Grenoble Alpes in partnership with INRIA and EDF. My research, under the supervision of [Bruno Raffin](https://team.inria.fr/datamove/team-members/bruno-raffin/), focused on _training deep learning models for numerical simulation at scale_.

Before my PhD, I worked 2 years in the space industry, including at the _European Space Agency_, developing software and deep learning methods for _remote sensing_. In 2018, I received a M.Sc in computer science from _Université de Montréal_, working on optimization software for swarm of robots with [Giovanni Beltrame](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/giovanni-beltrame). I graduated in software engineering and applied mathematics from _École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées_.
