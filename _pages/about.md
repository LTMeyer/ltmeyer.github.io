I am currently a final year PhD student in computer science and applied mathematics at Université Grenoble Alpes in partnership with [Électricité de France](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/inventing-the-future-of-energy/r-d-global-expertise). My research, under the supervision of [Bruno Raffin](https://team.inria.fr/datamove/team-members/bruno-raffin/) and Alejandro Ribes, focuses on *training deep learning models for numerical simulation at scale*.
