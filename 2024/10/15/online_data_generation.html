It summarizes the ideas of papers presented at <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581784.3607083" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SuperComputing</a> and <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/meyer23b.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICML</a>. <br><br> </div> <h1 id="bigger-models-need-bigger-datasets">Bigger Models Need Bigger Datasets</h1> <p>The current scaling laws of deep learning indicate that not only bigger models tend to perform better, but also that they require bigger datasets to do so. Nowadays, it is common to see training on hundreds of gigabytes if not terabytes of data. To such an extent that easily accessible large datasets are now hardly enough to train large models. There are some application domains, however, for which training data can be generated synthetically, and thus dataset virtually are unlimited. For instance, one can think about using first a smaller generative model to produce synthetic texts in order to train a larger model. For this post, we focus on AI for Science applications. In this context, training data can be generated by executing an external program: typically a numerical solver that takes as input physical parameters and simulates relevant quantities ruled by partial differential equations.</p> <h1 id="data-limitations-with-the-typical-training-pipeline">Data Limitations with the Typical Training Pipeline</h1> <p>The training pipeline on synthetically generated data is a two-step process. First, training data are produced using an oracle and stored to disk. Second, the actual training phase loads these data back from disk and performs the forward and backward passes to update model’s weights.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/traditional_training.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/traditional_training.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Typical Training Pipeline</b>: The dataset is generated beforehand, then loaded from disk. Data loading and model updates overlap. </div> <p>This process presents several disadvantages:</p> <ul> <li>Because I/O is much slower than computing, <strong>data generation is slow</strong>. Nonetheless, this cost is paid only once. The same dataset can be used for several trainings;</li> <li>For the same reason, because data are loaded from disk, the overall <strong>training phase may be slow</strong>. This is generally mitigated by overlapping data loading and model updates;</li> <li>Because disk storage is expensive and limited, <strong>the training dataset is generally reduced to hundreds of GBs</strong>;</li> <li>Because the dataset is generated beforehand, it is rare to generate only the data that are the most useful for training. <strong>Training does not benefit from techniques like active learning</strong>, curriculum learning, or Bayesian inference.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>How can we alleviate these limitations and improve large model training on synthetically generated data?</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="leveraging-network-speed">Leveraging Network Speed</h1> <p>One possible solution appears while considering the characteristics of hardware. On the clusters that are used both for the training of deep learning models and the running of numerical solvers, <strong>network speed is generally two orders faster than I/O</strong>. For instance, if we consider an SSD device with a random read speed of 200,000 IOPS and a block size of 4 KB, we will get a throughput of 0.8 GB/s. In comparison, regarding the network, InfiniBand individual signal rate can provide a throughput up to 25 GB/s. Besides, on these clusters, <strong>CPU hours are cheaper than storage</strong>.</p> <p>It is thus promising to move from a traditionally offline training pipeline to an online setting, where synthetic data are generated along the training. Multiple instances of the numerical solver are executed in parallel. Generated data are not stored on disk anymore, which circumvents I/O slowness. Instead, they are directly streamed through network for training. Training is thus faster. Because it needs less storage it is also cheaper. And because it allows using more data for the same training budget, it is also better.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/online_training.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/online_training.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Online Training Pipeline</b>: Dataset is generated on-the-fly.

The oracle is a program that can be written, but not necessarily, in Python. For instance, numerical solvers are often programs written in C or Fortran that run on multiple processes using MPI.</li> <li> <strong>Runner</strong>: The runner manages the executions of the clients. It triggers and monitors oracle executions on the clients. The runner serves as an orchestrator or a job scheduler. However, we avoid these terms to prevent any confusion with job schedulers commonly found on clusters (e.g. Slurm). The runner can nonetheless rely on such schedulers.</li> <li> <strong>Server</strong>: A server serve data to the training loop. It typically corresponds to the dataset of the deep learning training pipeline. It receives and consumes the data generated by the clients. There can be multiple servers in case of data distributed parallelism.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/framework_elements.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/framework_elements.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <b>Interaction between Framework Elements</b> </div> <p>There already exist some attempts to implement this kind of online training framework (e.g. <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05291" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Melissa</a>). However, these frameworks require advance HPC knowledge and adds a significant overlay to PyTorch, which limits their generic uses and thus adoption.</p> <h1 id="for-a-smooth-integration-to-pytorch">For a Smooth Integration to Pytorch</h1> <p>The online framework can be reduced to a data generation tool. The actual training loop of the model should be delegated to common deep learning libraries specifically designed for that (e.g. PyTorch or JAX). The framework should incur only minimal changes to the training loop. A good way to do so is by providing a dataset class that interfaces smoothly with these libraries. For instance, in the case of Pytorch, the framework should offer a class inheriting from the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IterableDataset</code></a>.</p> <p>In fact, in Pytorch, we can already obtain something similar with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DataLoader</code> of multiple workers in conjunction of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IterableDataset</code> object that would execute the oracle instances in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__iter__</code> method. This is nonetheless limited. There will be as many instances of the oracle running in parallel as the number of workers of the data loader. This number will be bounded by the number of CPUs associated to each GPU node. It does not take advantage of CPUs that would be available on other nodes of the cluster.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr>

This can be achieved by relying on a dedicated <em>Runner</em>. Several packages like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiprocessing.Pool</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dask</code></a>, or even <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">submitit</code></a> can then be used for the Runner.</p> <h1 id="an-event-driven-architecture">An Event-driven Architecture</h1> <p>By designing the framework as a set of clients, servers, and runner interacting altogether asynchronously, we are actually defining <strong>an event-driven application</strong>. Indeed, upon submission of new parameters by the server to the runner, the later must trigger the execution of a new oracle instance given the computational resources allocated. Upon generation of the data by the different oracle instances, they are streamed to the server, which in turns accumulate these data and yield batches. All the dynamics of the framework can be expressed as occurring events that must trigger a response. Even <em>fault tolerance</em> feature can be expressed as a monitoring of failing oracle instances that informs the server of the issue.</p> <p>Even though the event-driven architecture pattern seems fairly common and good libraries with probably similar approach exist (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dask</code> which uses a <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ioloop.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tornado.IOLoop</code></a>), I didn’t find a clear and minimal example on how to build such architectures in Python. This kind of examples would help to avoid thread deadlocks and difficult maintenance, which are common issues for asynchronous applications.</p> <blockquote> <p>What is a good approach for event-driven applications in Python that are not prone to deadlocks and easy to maintain?</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="a-minimal-example">A Minimal Example</h1> <p>In this section we present a minimal example that work locally.

</pre></td> </tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div> </div> </details> <h2 id="clients">Clients</h2> <p>For the client, we create a dummy example that generates random arrays for 20 time steps. In practice, the client can be any numerical simulation program. To work along the framework, the program must be edited to send the generated data over the network instead of saving them on disk, as it would be generally done. To do so, the program can use an API that is managed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ClientCommunicator</code> in the example below. This API does three things:</p> <ul> <li>initiate the communication between the client and the targeted servers (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__init__</code> method of the communicator);</li> <li>send data as they are produced through ZMQ socket (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">send_array</code> method);</li> <li>close the communication and signal the runner the client has terminated successfully (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terminate</code> method).</li> </ul> <p>Bindings to the API can be easily provided for Fortan, C, and C++ code that are generally used to write parallel numerical solvers.</p> <details> <summary>client.py<br><br></summary> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"> <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr>

Indeed, such online learning settings are not new and even common in domains like <em>reinforcement learning</em>. The submodule of the library <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ray</a> for reinforcement learning, <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RLlib</a>, allows orchestrating <em>Actors</em> that will explore the environment given a policy and send <em>state</em> and <em>rewards</em> to <em>Learners</em> that will update the policy. Both <em>Actors</em> and <em>Learners</em> run on different resources of a cluster. We can draw a clear parallel between the use case of RLlib and our framework design by identifying <em>Actors</em> with <em>Clients</em>, <em>Learners</em> with <em>Servers</em>, and <em>rewards</em> with <em>simulated data</em> by the oracle. The comparison is nonetheless limited. With RLlib, <em>Actors</em> are generally Python executables that run on a single process, whereas in our case the oracle is most likely to be a non-Python program that runs on multiple processes using MPI. It is not clear yet how RLlib can be tweaked to support the proposed framework.</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <ul> <li>We presented an online deep learning framework tailored for AI for Science applications;</li> <li>We provided a starting example of such framework;</li> <li>Wait a minute! You said better, cheaper, and faster? By alleviating IO, the framework accelerates data generation thus training. By reducing disk storage use it also makes it cheaper.
